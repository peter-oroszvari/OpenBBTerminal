        very, very short-term early stock market indicator is <strong>&#128274;</strong>.&nbsp;This
        indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors
        to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently
        undertake quick trades.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Protection Band And What
        To Do Now</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is important for investors to look
        ahead and not in the rearview mirror.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Consider continuing
        to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk
        preference, consider holding <strong>&#128274;</strong> in cash or Treasury
        bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term
        hedges of <strong>&#128274;</strong>, and short term hedges of <strong>&#128274;</strong>.
        This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the
        same time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You can determine your protection bands by adding
        cash to hedges.&nbsp;The high band of the protection is appropriate for those
        who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate
        for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp;If you do not hedge, the total
        cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash
        plus hedges.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>It is worth reminding that you cannot
        take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough
        cash.&nbsp;</strong>When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial
        stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops
        on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp;High
        beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Traditional
        60/40 Portfolio</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Probability based risk reward
        adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation
        at this time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Those who want to stick to traditional 60%
        allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality
        bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring
        sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical
        positions and not strategic positions at this time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The

        it had placed a big bet on AI development by investing&nbsp;$4 billion in
        AI company Anthropic, which makes chatbots that rival&nbsp;Microsoft Corporation
        (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\\\">MSFT</a>)-backed&nbsp;OpenAI&rsquo;s
        ChatGPT.&nbsp;With the aim to advance generative AI development, the strategic
        partnership will make&nbsp;Amazon Web Services&nbsp;the startup&rsquo;s&nbsp;primary
        cloud provider&nbsp;while&nbsp;AWS customers&nbsp;will gain early access to
        unique features for model customization along with fine-tuning capabilities
        from Anthropic who was founded by former OpenAI research executives. Anthropic
        recently&nbsp;debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2&nbsp;and is Amazon&rsquo;s
        latest conquest as it continues competing against Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ:<a
        class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ\\\">GOOG</a>)
        in AI development.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>The Deal Is More About Chip Development
        Than Chatbot Rivalry</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>San Francisco-based Anthropic has
        its own AI chatbot that rivals that of Microsoft-backed ChatGPT. Released
        in July, Claude 2&nbsp;will help AWS customers to develop new generative AI-powered
        applications that have the power to completely transform their organizations.
        But, more importantly, Anthropic and Amazon agreed to develop the next set
        of chips together with Anthropic agreeing to use Amazon&rsquo;s chips to develop
        its future models. Therefore, the bigger picture is about a power shift on
        the AI chip front, maybe not in a year, but in about five years, this deal
        could power Amazon to dramatically change yet another competitive landscape.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Challenging
        Nvidia, The AI Chip King</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Moreover, Amazon&rsquo;s deal
        with Anthropic aims to show that alternative chips can be used for fueling
        AI, therefore, challenging the dominance of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:<a
        class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\\\">NVDA</a>).
        The key product of Nvidia&nbsp;is a GPU, semiconductor that is used to train
        large AI models.&nbsp;With the AI hype, Nvidia smashed financial forecasts,
        but that may no longer be the case in the future as Amazon clearly showed
        its intention of developing customized AWS chips. Nvidia is currently the
        undebatable AI winner simply because it got into it long before anyone else.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Tech
        Giants And Their AI Ambitions</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Big Tech is increasingly
        entering collaborations with smaller AI firms. Although Microsoft led the
        way with its multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, Amazon just swooped
        up a AI hotspot, simultaneously beating Google who was an early investor in
        Anthropic with the AI startup announcing only seven months ago that it had
        selected Google as its cloud provider. But Amazon does not have a record of
        chasing markets but rather creating them. Therefore, only time will show Amazon&rsquo;s
        new creation and contribution to the AI future in-the-making.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>DISCLAIMER:

        share of Apple&#8217;s revenue will decline from 40-45% to 25-30% over the
        next five years, with roughly half of this reduction stemming from the shift
        of production to India.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This shift is significant because,

        that India&#8217;s revenue \u2014 currently accounting for 3% or $12 billion
        of Apple&#8217;s total sales \u2014 will eventually surpass that of Greater
        China. Greater China, encompassing mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan,

        to increase fivefold over the next four to five years, reaching $40 billion,
        as noted by Munster.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Currently, an estimated 2% of
        Apple&#8217;s revenue is derived from India, but this figure is expected to
        rise in the coming five years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The reported target of reaching
        $40 billion in production in India by 2027 implies a remarkable annual production
        growth rate of 42% in India. This stands in stark contrast to Apple&#8217;s
        projected 5% or higher revenue growth rate during the same period, according
        to Munster.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;India is central to Apple navigating

        that Apple has used. \\\"The glass did not like being pressed or flexed by
        my thumb. That's crazy,\\\" he said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong>
        Apple has reduced the price of replacing the back glass of the iPhone 15 Pro
        to $169 from $499 for the iPhone 14 Pro. Likewise, the iPhone 15 Pro Max'
        back glass costs $199 compared to $549 for the iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Essentially,
        it's now three times cheaper to replace the back glass, but going by Nelson's
        test, it's also far easier to break it. You might end up spending more to
        get it replaced throughout your use.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-embed

        iPhone 15 Pro Buyers Complain Of Overheating, Some Report Throttling And Discoloration
        Issues</em></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> In his latest
        teardown of the iPhone 15 Pro Max, Zack Nelson of JerryRigEverything estimates
        that there's approximately $30 worth of titanium in Apple's latest top-tier
        iPhone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the highlights of the iPhone 15 Pro Max is
        the aerospace-grade titanium \u2013 the same titanium used on the <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/09/34507964/apple-designed-the-iphone-15-pro-with-the-same-material-that-is-used-for-the-mars-rover\\\">Mars
        rover Perseverance</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Apple drew inspiration from the
        Apple Watch Ultra and brought over this material to the iPhones. This helped
        the company reduce the weight of the otherwise bulky iPhone 15 Pro models
        by 10% compared to their predecessors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But it's not just
        the weight reduction that users will appreciate \u2013 according to Nelson,
        the titanium design takes \\\"extreme skill and expertise\\\" to work with.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\\"It
        is not an easy thing to do and the frame of this phone is still just as exquisite
        as every intern-generated buzzword at the event said it would be. Ten thumbs
        up to Apple for doing something new,\\\" he said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why
        It Matters:</strong> Apple touted the much more premium titanium design of
        the iPhone 15 Pro models, using it as a feature that sets it apart from other
        phones and the non-Pro iPhone 15 models.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, the titanium
        design has been in the news for the wrong reasons. Early buyers have been

        about issues like discoloration and the color chipping off too easily.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Multiple
        users and tests have <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/09/34820742/so-is-the-iphone-15-pros-titanium-build-stronger-what-an-early-drop-test-reveals\\\">also
        shown</a> that the iPhone 15 Pro Max is less durable than its predecessor.
        Unlike the stainless steel band on the iPhone 14 Pro Max, the titanium sides
        of the iPhone 15 Pro end up dispersing the pressure of the impact to the front
        and back glass, leading to spiderweb cracks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Regardless,

        And Britain Price Drops:</strong>&nbsp;Interestingly, Meta has reportedly

        is not going the whole hog right now, though \u2013 the first OxygenOS 14
        beta shows that this Dynamic Island styling has been implemented only for
        the screen recorder controls.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A video posted by a user,

        reminds us a lot of Apple's Dynamic Island. While the information chip is
        not centered like it is on Apple's iPhones, the expanded controls and the

        unclear whether this feature will be limited to the screen recorder or expanded
        to other system actions and third-party apps. However, OnePlus has taken the
        first step to possibly see how it's done and whether users like it or not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>More
        On OxygenOS 14:</strong> The OnePlus 11 will be the first smartphone to get
        the OxygenOS 14 update based on Android 14. OnePlus has already rolled out
        the first open beta; the final release is expected in November. Other devices
        will start getting the update later, with the first open beta update expected
        scheduled to roll out in November.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The update includes security
        and privacy enhancements, which are a part of Android 14. OnePlus <a href=\\\"https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1427813089402683400\\\">says</a>
        it has also made some performance improvements using algorithms, but beyond

        Apple&#8217;s retail staff is advised to inform customers that the FineWoven
        material is a &#8220;luxurious microtwill&#8221; with a &#8220;soft yet durable
        suede-like texture.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Staff members are directed to
        address durability concerns by informing customers that FineWoven cases may
        exhibit signs of wear over time due to fiber compression from regular use.
        Apple also restates that &#8220;MagSafe&nbsp;accessories on the FineWoven
        Case&nbsp;with MagSafe will leave slight&nbsp;imprints,&#8221; a point previously
        communicated by the company.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By likening these characteristics
        to leather and other materials, Apple suggests a shift away from leather cases.
        However, the backlash against FineWoven cases could potentially affect customers&#8217;
        inclination towards environmentally friendly alternatives in the future.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Apple
        has also provided its staff with guidelines on cleaning FineWoven accessories,
        in line with its support document on &#8220;how to clean your Apple products.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why
        It Matters</strong>: This move comes on the heels of other complaints associated
        with the iPhone 15. Some early buyers of the iPhone 15 Pro are <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/09/34864785/early-iphone-15-pro-buyers-complain-of-overheating-some-report-throttling-and-discoloration-issues\\\">reporting
        issues</a> like overheating, throttling, and scratches on the new titanium

        as &#8220;Project Nova,&#8221; while the transformation of the Action button
        into a capacitive feature is known as &#8220;Project Atlas.&#8221; Previously,
        &#8220;Project Bongo&#8221; was the codename used for the implementation of
        capacitive buttons on the remaining controls.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This development
        comes after a previously reported attempt to introduce capacitive buttons
        on the iPhone 15, which was eventually abandoned during development.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        addition to the &#8220;Capture Button,&#8221; the&nbsp;<strong>Action</strong>&nbsp;button
        would undergo a capacitive transformation, enhancing user interaction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These
        new capacitive buttons could have pressure sensors, allowing them to respond
        to the force applied during a press, which could reduce accidental button
        activations \u2014 a common issue for smartphone users.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Moreover,
        the mmWave cutout, initially situated below the sleep/wake button, is rumored
        to be repositioned below the volume buttons on the opposite side. This change
        in layout would apply to devices equipped with a physical SIM slot, the report
        noted.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although the credibility of this information
        remains uncertain due to the anonymous source, if these rumors hold true,

        hard-right House Freedom Caucus is arguing for spending cuts on all appropriation
        bills that need to pass to avoid a shutdown. Border control and financial

        into an almost impossible-to-solve quarrel. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even GOP proposals
        for a temporary stop-gap spending bill, also known as a continuing resolution,
        carry too many politically heavy measures to pass the Democratic-controlled
        Senate.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On Monday, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> said that
        he backs the decision to shut down the government unless Democrats and less
        conservative Republicans agree with the demands of the Freedom Caucus.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\\"Unless

        voted to suspend the debt ceiling for two years</a>, allowing the government
        to take on the extra debt it needs to operate. The deal was reached between
        Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy after weeks of suspense, taking the
        government dangerously close to defaulting \u2014 the equivalent of running
        out of money in the bank.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the midst of this crisis, <a

        federal government reached its highest debt mark ever</a>: $33 trillion. This
        number is well over 12 times the market cap of <strong>Apple</strong> the
        world's most valuable public company, or about twice the annual GDP of the
        entire European Union.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After the $33 trillion mark was passed,

        government borrowed an average of $1 billion per hour.</a> If borrowing continues
        at the same pace, debt could reach $50 trillion by the end of the decade.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Are
        Bush and Trump to Blame?</strong> According to a study released earlier this
        year, the recent spike in the country's debt ratio is directly related to
        tax cuts enacted during the last three Republican executive terms, including
        Trump's recent presidency and <strong>George W. Bush</strong>'s two terms
        between 2001 and 2009.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The debt ratio is understood as the
        total public debt as a percent of gross domestic product, and it currently
        equals 120%, meaning that the total worth of the U.S. debt surpasses its GDP
        by 20%. The U.S. has been owing more money than it produces since 2012, yet
        the government has had trouble bringing down the debt ratio since it spiked
        during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to an analysis by
        the Center for American Progress, federal debt as a percentage of the U.S.
        economy is on a path to grow indefinitely. Part of the reason behind this
        growing trend is demographic: increasing life expectancy, declining fertility,
        decreased immigration and rising health care costs are causing government
        revenue to fall behind spending.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The study authors
        argue that, while some Republican lawmakers are looking to enact spending
        cuts to overcome this issue, the real root comes from Republican measures
        taken during the Bush and Trump presidencies while they held control of the
        Congress.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\\"If not for the Bush tax cut and their
        extensions \u2014 as well as the Trump tax cuts \u2014 revenues would be on
        track to keep pace with spending indefinitely, and the debt ratio (debt as
        a percentage of the economy) would be declining,\\\" <a href=\\\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/tax-cuts-are-primarily-responsible-for-the-increasing-debt-ratio/\\\">reads</a>
        the study.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The tax cuts are responsible for 57% of the increase
        in the debt ratio since Bush's first government in 2001. That number would
        reach 90% if we removed the \\\"one-time costs\\\" from bills responding to
        COVID-19 and the Great Recession.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the study,
        tax cuts enacted by the Bush administration in 2001 will have cost more than
        $8 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2023. Yet the tax cuts were not aimed
        at helping the average citizen.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\\"These changes were enormously
        tilted toward the rich and wealthy,\\\" says the report.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        U.S., compared to other countries in the OECD, is a relatively low-tax country,
        with only 26% of tax revenue as a percentage of GDP, compared to an EU average
        of 37%. Rates for Italy and France are even higher, at 43% and 45%, respectively.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tax
        cuts signed by Trump in 2017 will have cost roughly $1.7 trillion by the end
        of fiscal year 2023, said the report.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The analysts recommend
        revising tax cuts \\\"that largely benefited the wealthy,\\\" as a means to
        reduce government deficit.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Image made using Midjourney
